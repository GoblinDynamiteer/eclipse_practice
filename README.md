#ECLIPSE PRACTICE

---

*Learning Eclipse IDE.* 

As an alternative to NotePad++ text editor, which has been my main program for writing code.  

## Eclipse projects:  
**CFB_Sodku**  
Remake of programming excercise from book *C Från Början*.  Checks if a sudoku "array" is filled out correctly.

**SDL_Ballz**  
Playing around with SDL library.
